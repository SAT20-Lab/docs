The SAT20 protocol consists of two components: the asset issuance protocol and the asset circulation protocol. Asset Issuance Protocol (ORDX) The SAT20 asset issuance protocol is an enhanced version of the Ordinals protocol. It is used to issue assets called SAT20 assets. These assets are bound to satoshis and inherit the properties of satoshis: 1. Satoshis are not destructible, so the assets are also non-destructible. 2. The data bound to satoshis is immutable, so once the assets are issued, they cannot be modified. 3. Wherever the satoshis are, the assets are also present, allowing assets to freely move across different networks alongside satoshis. 4. Assets belong to the owner of the satoshis, so when satoshis are transferred, the assets are transferred as well. 5. The non-fungible nature of satoshis determines the non-fungibility of assets, making them inherently SFT (Semi-Fungible Token) assets. 6. Satoshis can be bound to any data, including smart contracts, enabling assets to have a certain level of intelligence. Asset Circulation Protocol (Transcend) The SAT20 asset circulation protocol defines the rules for the circulation of satoshis and provides an implementation sample. 1. Satoshis Locking: Satoshis can be locked and unlocked via the Lightning Network channels, allowing users to exit autonomously and ensuring the safety of their funds. 2. Satoshis Transcending: Locked satoshis are automatically transcended to the second layer networks, allowing them to continue circulating as satoshis within these networks. Users can transcend Satoshi back to the mainnet at any time. 3. Satoshis Swapping: The core technology enabling the free movement of satoshis within the second layer networks. 4. Core Principles: * Safe Withdrawal: Users can decide to withdraw from the second layer networks at any time without requiring permission from others. * Client Verification: Users can self-verify whether an asset is bound to a satoshi by its identifier. * Complete asset transfer history Vision One sat, one world.

It is built on BTC core, and any technology that benefits the development of BTC can be tested on this network. Open Source To ensure efficient early-stage development, we will initially keep the project closed source. However, we plan to gradually open and eventually fully open-source the entire SAT20 project. Through community management, SAT20 will evolve into a fully decentralized project that can incorporate any BTC-native technologies, such as BTC native smart contracts or any future BTC-native layer 2 networks. We aim to promote mass adoption of SAT20 within the BTC ecosystem through open-source, permissionless collaboration and contribute to the prosperity of the BTC ecosystem.

It is decentralized, permissionless, and audit-resistant, and anyone can access and use it. The TVN network features the following capabilities: Self-Custodied Web3 Accounts Everyone can create a web3 account directly and free of charge. The TVN network incorporates a comprehensive self-custody system for web3 accounts, empowering users to manage their accounts independently. SAT20-based Name Service Immutable and permissionless names that cannot be tampered with or blocked. Users can bind their accounts with names they mint or acquire from other sources, creating their own Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). SAT20-based Key Sharding Storage Service Private keys are split into multiple shards and distributed across multiple satoshis, eliminating concerns about losing or compromising mnemonic phrases. Super Accounts Accounts on the TVN network are super accounts capable of connecting numerous sub-accounts and bridging across multiple blockchains. P2P Messaging System An encrypted end-to-end messaging system is built into the network, allowing users to create public channels as well. Integrated SAT20 DEX The TVN network integrates with a SAT20 decentralized exchange (DEX), enabling users to participate in digital asset trading while maintaining full control of their funds. Hierarchical Data Storage Users can encrypt and store their data using their own keys, with different levels of importance distributed across various networks. The most critical assets and data are stored on the BTC network, ensuring they are never lost, albeit at a higher cost.

The SAT20 Asset Circulation Protocol is just a protocol and not a Layer 2 network itself. Currently, there is no existing Layer 2 network supported natively by BTC in the market. While the Lightning Network is natively supported by BTC, it is not a network per se but rather a state channel protocol. The BTC ecosystem needs a native Layer 2 network that allows BTC to freely circulate onto the Layer 2 network. What is a BTC native Layer 2 network? We believe there is only one standard: complete user control. Users must have full control over the security of their assets without needing anyone's permission. They should be able to enter and exit the Layer 2 network at any time without compromising the security of their assets. A fitting analogy is that the Layer 1 network represents the real world, and we use a tool to enter a virtual world. This virtual world is the Layer 2 network, where you can always maintain self-awareness and independently decide to exit the virtual world and return to the real world. That tool is the SAT20 Asset Circulation Protocol. The SAT20 Asset Circulation Protocol is designed to be compatible with all BTC native Layer 2 networks, whether existing or yet to emerge. The core concepts of the SAT20 Asset Circulation Protocol include: Sat Locking and Unlocking: Using Lightning Network channel technology, sats are locked on the mainnet. The battle-tested Lightning Network channel technology ensures the security of user assets. Sat Transcending: Sats can transcend between Layer 1 and Layer 2, entirely controlled by the user. Sat Swapping: Sats within the Layer 2 network gain remarkable liquidity through sat swapping. Enhanced UTXO Model: In the Layer 2 network, the enhanced UTXO model allows additional information about sats to be stored in enhanced UTXOs. Client Verification: The authenticity of any sat asset can be verified through its sequence number and asset issuance records. SVM: Sat Virtual Machine, maximizing the capabilities of sats. Locking, unlocking, and transcending to the layer-2 network require a mature channel technology. Essentially, these channel technologies are constructed using BTC script languages. SAT20 can utilize any proven and secure scripts to accomplish the locking and unlocking tasks for satoshis. So far, the most mature channel technology is the Lightning Network's channel technology. Therefore, we have implemented the SAT20 asset circulation protocol on top of the Lightning Network channel technology and demonstrated the protocol's capabilities through a sample project.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"circulation/readme/#sat20-asset-circulation-protocol-transend","text":"The SAT20 Asset Circulation Protocol is a protocol that outlines how Satoshis (sats) can enter the BTC native Layer 2 network, how they can be traded and transferred within the Layer 2 network, and how they can be securely returned to the Layer 1 mainnet.

The BTC ecosystem needs a native Layer 2 network that allows BTC to freely circulate onto the Layer 2 network. What is a BTC native Layer 2 network? We believe there is only one standard: complete user control. Users must have full control over the security of their assets without needing anyone's permission. They should be able to enter and exit the Layer 2 network at any time without compromising the security of their assets. A fitting analogy is that the Layer 1 network represents the real world, and we use a tool to enter a virtual world. This virtual world is the Layer 2 network, where you can always maintain self-awareness and independently decide to exit the virtual world and return to the real world. That tool is the SAT20 Asset Circulation Protocol. The SAT20 Asset Circulation Protocol is designed to be compatible with all BTC native Layer 2 networks, whether existing or yet to emerge. The core concepts of the SAT20 Asset Circulation Protocol include: Sat Locking and Unlocking: Using Lightning Network channel technology, sats are locked on the mainnet. The battle-tested Lightning Network channel technology ensures the security of user assets. Sat Transcending: Sats can transcend between Layer 1 and Layer 2, entirely controlled by the user. Sat Swapping: Sats within the Layer 2 network gain remarkable liquidity through sat swapping. Enhanced UTXO Model: In the Layer 2 network, the enhanced UTXO model allows additional information about sats to be stored in enhanced UTXOs. Client Verification: The authenticity of any sat asset can be verified through its sequence number and asset issuance records. SVM: Sat Virtual Machine, maximizing the capabilities of sats. Locking, unlocking, and transcending to the layer-2 network require a mature channel technology. Essentially, these channel technologies are constructed using BTC script languages. SAT20 can utilize any proven and secure scripts to accomplish the locking and unlocking tasks for satoshis. So far, the most mature channel technology is the Lightning Network's channel technology. Therefore, we have implemented the SAT20 asset circulation protocol on top of the Lightning Network channel technology and demonstrated the protocol's capabilities through a sample project.","title":"SAT20 Asset Circulation Protocol: Transend"},{"location":"circulation/satlock/","text":"Locking and Unlocking of Satoshis Locking and unlocking satoshis are necessary conditions for assets to move from layer-1 to layer-2.

However, the ordinal numbers are 64-bit integers, which are too long and not easy to remember. In order to quickly index each satoshi, it is necessary to develop a name service based on satoshis, allowing users to remember satoshis that hold significant meaning to them. The relationship between ordinal numbers and names is similar to the relationship between IP addresses and domain names. The SAT20 Name Service is a completely decentralized, BTC-based name service that is available to everyone on a fair basis and is not controlled by any third party. The core of the name service is that each name is unique, and there are no sub-namespace. This avoids the possibility of fraud. Each name is an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) that is engraved on a satoshi. A Satoshi has only one name, and the name and Satoshi are also in one-to-one correspondence. Names are bound to satoshis, so whoever owns the satoshi also owns the name. When a satoshi is transferred, the name is transferred along with it. Names are also a type of sat asset. Naming Rules The first instance of a name is valid. Names use UTF-8 characters. Case-insensitive. All names/namespaces will be indexed in lowercase. No spaces are allowed in names. No punctuation marks are allowed in names. (Names with periods are from other name protocols.) Name length starts from 3 bytes, but 4-byte names are temporarily prohibited from registration. Note: The 4-byte names are reserved for BRC20 tickers. 1-2 byte names are for internal protocol use only and are prohibited from registration at the protocol level. They will never be opened for registration to prevent unnecessary speculation. Combination Rules Names can be combined to form a special meaning. The protocol establishes the following basic rules: 1. Names are combined using the \"@\" symbol, such as Alice@sat20. 2. Both parties need to sign and agree to the combination, meaning that the combination represents a contractual relationship. 3. The latter name, such as \"sat20,\" belongs to a higher-level organizational form, such as a company or club. Compatibility The SAT20 Name Service is compatible with the major name services currently on the BTC network. For example, taking .btc as an example, a name like 1.btc will be treated as a whole, rather than splitting it into the name \"1\" and the namespace \".btc\". As our development progresses, we plan to be compatible with these name services (read-only, without support for minting): 1. .btc 2. .x 3. Others Note that names with a \".\" and names without a \".\" are different names. For example, 123.btc and 123 are two independent names with no relationship to each other. Monopolistic Resources Names are core resources and also assets. For example, the name \"Pearl\" as a ticker name is a name automatically held by the address that deployed the ticker. If a name has already been registered, other people cannot deploy a ticker for that name. By registering a name, one automatically gains all the permissions associated with that name, and the SAT20 protocol maintains these permissions. Royalties The owner of a resource will automatically receive royalties based on a configurable tax rate when the resource is used.

This means that within the valid range, each ordinal number corresponds to a satoshi, and each satoshi corresponds to an ordinal number. This strict one-to-one relationship is permanent. The basic principles of ordinal numbers are as follows: 1. The ordinal number of the first satoshi is 0. 2. The numbering follows the order of creation without any gaps. 3. Satoshis are transferred in a first-in, first-out manner. 4. In reward transactions, the rewarded satoshis are the first inputs, followed by other transactions' satoshis as fees in sequential order. 5. The rewarded quantity matches the actual reward quantity exactly. The ordinal number theory of SAT20 is derived from the Ordinals protocol, but there are fundamental differences between them: 1. The Ordinals protocol considers satoshis to be destroyable, and in fact, 2,895,502,904 satoshis have already been destroyed within the Ordinals ordinal number theory system before block 840000. This result can be confirmed by querying the Ordinals website (https://ordinals.com/status). 2. The Ordinals protocol assigns ordinal numbers to satoshis based on theory, resulting in many ordinal numbers that do not have actual satoshis corresponding to them. For example, at height 840,000, which is the fourth halving, the first satoshi of the block, called \"epic,\" has the ordinal number 1,968,750,000,000,000. This might give the impression that 19,687,500 BTC have already been issued. However, in reality, before this height, there were slightly less than 19,687,497.2 BTC in circulation, as there were many reward blocks that were not fully claimed. Therefore, in the Ordinals ordinal number theory, for the epic satoshi with the ordinal number 1,968,750,000,000,000 at the fourth halving, there are many ordinal numbers before it that do not have corresponding satoshis. SAT20 does not directly adopt the ordinal number theory of the Ordinals protocol, mainly because we consider satoshis to be non-destructible. This fundamental difference from the ordinal number theory of the Ordinals protocol makes it impossible for us to develop SAT20 assets based on the Ordinals ordinal number theory. Fortunately, the ordinal number theory of Ordinals has officially entered the BIP process. We look forward to the satoshis having a formal numbering rule as soon as possible, and we hope that the numbering of satoshis will better align with the fundamental principles of BTC and be based on the actual situation. Once there is a standardized scheme for satoshi numbering, we will respond promptly to the standard satoshi numbering rules, which will not affect the security of SAT20 assets. Furthermore, SAT20 fully supports Ordinals NFTs because Ordinals NFTs are assets bound to satoshis, which align with the definition of SAT20 assets. In other words, Ordinals NFTs are also a type of SAT20 asset. (Note: The Ordinals theory now has an official BIP number and has entered the consideration process. The possibility of the Ordinals theory becoming a BTC standard is very high. Ultimately, the encoding scheme used by the Ordinals theory will become the encoding scheme for SAT20.

Its core is the binding of satoshis , hence the name \"Sat Asset\" (SAT20 ASSETS). Sat Assets have distinctive characteristics and are the world's first \" satoshi standard \" native BTC asset issuance protocol, where assets possess the properties of satoshis. Basic Properties of SAT20 Assets Satoshis are not destructible, so the assets are also non-destructible. The data bound to satoshis is immutable, so once the assets are issued, they cannot be modified. Wherever the satoshis are, the assets are also present, allowing assets to freely move across different networks alongside satoshis. Assets belong to the owner of the satoshis, so when satoshis are transferred, the assets are transferred as well. The non-fungible nature of satoshis determines the non-fungibility of assets, making them inherently SFT (Semi-Fungible Token) assets. Satoshis can be bound to any data, including smart contracts, enabling assets to have a certain level of intelligence. Basic Capabilities of SAT20 Assets The issuance of SAT20 assets relies on two basic capabilities: 1. The ability to identify satoshis and track them. 2. The ability to read and write data on satoshis. Core Principles of SAT20 Assets SAT20 assets are built upon the two fundamental properties of satoshis, which are also the core principles of SAT20 assets: 1. The non-fungible nature of satoshis. The order of creation of satoshis determines their uniqueness and identifiability. Each satoshi can be encoded using a certain encoding scheme, serving as its identification that remains unchanged. 2. The non-destructible nature of satoshis. BTC operates on a ledger model that requires ledger balance. Satoshis, being inputs and outputs of the ledger, cannot be destroyed, as it would result in an imbalanced ledger. Other Related Services In addition, for convenient indexing and data manipulation of satoshis, some core services based on satoshis must be established: 1. Naming service. Based on satoshis, it facilitates memorability and propagation, serving as the foundation of IP (Intellectual Property) development and an essential core service for protocol evolution. 2. Data service. It enables the reading and writing of data bound to satoshis, where only the owner can write while anyone can read. In the future, income-generating services will require payment for accessing data. 3. Payment service. SAT20 supports running software compiled into the WASM (WebAssembly) format on a virtual machine (VM). When income-generating services run other software packages on the VM, fees are charged, which are shared between node providers and software developers. The fees are low but not zero, denominated in satoshis.
